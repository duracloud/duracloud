## What is DuraCloud?

DuraCloud is a suite of open source software applications used together to manage files stored in a variety of third-party storage systems. DuraCloud connects to storage in commercial cloud systems, academic storage systems, and national preservation networks, providing a consistent API and interface through which content can be managed. DuraCloud also handles the duplication of content across providers and performs bit-level integrity checking to verify that stored content remains unchanged.

DuraCloud was created by [DuraSpace](http://duraspace.org/), a non-profit organization, to provide a hosted preservation storage solution as a service for those charged with managing digital content, but who do not have the tools to ensure that content is preserved. We invite anyone interested in digital preservation, especially preservation for the common good, to help us maintain, improve, and deploy DuraCloud to prevent the loss of culturally relevant digital content.
